      The Philippines has the highest percentage of users to population ratio in
      Facebook against all other countries around the world. As of July 2022,
      there are 89 million active Facebook users in the Philippines. As it
      stands, a majority of Filipinos, especially the youth, are active on
      social media.
    </p>
    <p>
      This however does not imply authenticity of use. With complete freedom for
      use and anonymity, the landscape of Philippine social media is rampant
      with irresponsible and misleading information. While genuine discourse and
      discussions that form from credible resources resonate with our values,
      the same cannot be said for the intentional spread of disinformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where Cedula comes in. By verifying Filipino authenticity, we can
      promote accountable and responsible use of social media. While this does
      not directly stop misinformation, it prevents rampant spread of
      disinformation by empowering users with a simple truth, other users are
      real Filipinos.
